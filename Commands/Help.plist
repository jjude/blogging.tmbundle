Blogging Bundle Configuration Settings
--------------------------------------

This bundle requires the following environment variables to be preset.

* TM\_BLOG\_ENDPOINT: The XMLRPC endpoint to post to. Should be in the form: http://host/xmlrpcscript#blog\_id or http://user@host/xmlrpcscript#blog\_id (the "#blog_id" portion is optional if your blogging software doesn't require it). This value can be overriden by a "Blog" header within a post.
* TM\_BLOG\_FORMAT: Your preferred formatting choice (default will derive from current blog template selected).
* TM\_BLOG\_MODE: 'mt' and 'wp' are valid settings for this. Influences the posting API to be as compatible as possible with Movable Type, Blogger and WordPress variants of the metaWeblog API (default will derive from endpoint URL, or will default to 'mt').

Getting Started
---------------

After you've configured for your weblog, try the "Fetch Post" command to retrieve an existing post for editing. This is the easiest way to confirm that your configuration is correct. Once you have that working, you should have no problem publishing a new post.

To create a new weblog entry, create a new document from one of the Blogging templates:

* Weblog Post (Markdown)
* Weblog Post (Textile)
* Weblog Post (HTML)
* Weblog Post (Text)

Each of these will give you a basic heading section followed with the text of the post itself. Additional headers are defined as snippets within this bundle. Once you've composed your post, use the "Post to Blog" command to publish it. Upon a successful post (and assuming you elected to publish the post, instead of setting it to a draft state), your browser will open to the published page.

Commands
--------

* **Post to Blog**: Takes a new or edited post and publishes it to your configured blog.
* **Fetch Post**: Selects the last 20 posts and lets you choose one for editing. This will create a new document locally that you can edit and then republish using the Post to Blog command.
* **View Post**: For a published post (one with a Post ID within the document), this command will take you to the permalink for that post.

Posting to Multiple Blogs
-------------------------

A post's headers may contain a "Blog" header. This header lets you target any weblog endpoint. To make selection of the endpoint easier, I recommend modifying this bundle by adding additional "Blog" header snippets. An example snippet is provided and ready for you to customize.
